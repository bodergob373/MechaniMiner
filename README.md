# MechaniMiner

A Roblox Game about building a mining vehicle, collecting resources, selling them, and obtaining more blocks to upgrade the vehicle through crafting or buying.

## NOTE: 
For these hours, I only did some new parts of the game. The rest of the game doesn't really work yet.
### The things I added are: 
- Models for blocks: Furnace, Internal Combustion Engine, Steam Engine, Suspension, Shafts
- Terrain modeling: Mountains in back
- Creation Saving system: Compiles and stores blocks, block grids and positional data
- New Building System: Allows non-static blocks to be placed on different grids, handling block dimensions, rotations, bounds, and mechanical blocks containing multiple grids
- Internal Creation Tracking: Dynamically stores data about grids, blocks + positions/orientations relative to grids, and root parts as blocks are placed and deleted while handling grid creation and splitting
